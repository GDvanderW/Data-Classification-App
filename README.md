# Data-Classification-App

The purpose of the data classification application is to provide a South African business the ability to classify personal information it keeps on behalf of individuals, regardless of the storage mechanism used. There are several off-the-shelve products available with various degrees of successful automatic classification, but in most cases are limited in its ability to work across multiple platforms or environments. An example of one such implementation is Redgate SQL Data Catalog. This solution provides an ability to automatically classify fields in a SQL database and in most cases are pretty good at uncovering protected or sensitive information. However, the implementation relies on field names and because it is not a South African product, the regular expression rules that come standard out od the box does not work in our environment. Also, Data Catalog only works on a Microsoft SQL Datastore, meaning that personal information stored on other media, or other data sources such as active directory and excel cannot be classified.
